<h3> The History of Rap & Hip-Hop</h3>
<p class="fronttext">At early 1970s block parties in New York City, DJs started isolating and extending the percussion breaks of funk, soul, and disco songs. This is how the genre of rap was born. 
    In between songs, MCs, who were in charge of introducing the DJs and energising the crowd, would joke around and engage the spectators. 
    The MCs (or rappers, as they eventually came to be known) started to frequently talk and rhyme over and in time with the music over time. 
    Rap music demonstrated its financial viability in 1979 with the release of The Sugarhill Gang's "Rapper's Delight," and then again in 1980 with Kurtis Blow's "The Breaks," a Top 5 hit that eventually earned gold. Rap music was initially viewed as a passing craze.
